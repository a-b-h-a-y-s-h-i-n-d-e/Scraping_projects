Heidi,Abele,realestates@heidiabele.com,(408)605-7847,(408)605-7847,https://heidiabelerealtor.com/,"You’re ready to sell your property. And, while you’re looking forward to seeing the word “SOLD” posted from the curb, you know there’s a lot to consider along the way. One of your first decisions is to select a real estate agent who’ll join you in the process.  You deserve much more than a sign in the yard, fliers in a box and an occasional open house. You deserve an agent who will be at your side, from listing to closing, ensuring that your property sells smoothly and you get the most money possible from the sale.   My local real estate market expertise means I’m able to interpret all data that dictates the optimum pricing strategy, so your property will be priced to sell. I dig deep to learn the unique selling points of your property and neighborhood. So my marketing plans and staging strategies will effectively target and attract your potential buyers. It’s a formula for success.  And, of course, I’ll take the time to listen, understand your challenges and goals and answer any questions you may have along the way.   I appreciate the opportunity to earn your business and look forward to meeting with you!","Campbell, Los Gatos, San Jose",English,Keller Williams - Silicon Valley,https://www.kw.com/agent/UPA-6587385179144187908-1#undefined
